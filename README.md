# Employee Management System
1. Summary
- The Employee Management System is a Python and Django-based mini project designed to streamline the management of employee information within an organization.
It allows users to add, delete, update, and view employee details, providing a centralized database for efficient personnel management.

2. Uses
- Employee Information Management: Easily store and organize employee details such as first name, last name, designation, roles, salary, and bonus in a structured manner.
- Database Operations: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
- Efficient Record Handling: Facilitates the quick retrieval and modification of employee data, enhancing the overall efficiency of HR or administrative tasks.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the database, making it accessible for users with varying technical expertise.
3. Working
- Adding Employees
Users can input relevant employee details, including first name, last name, designation, roles, salary, and bonus.
The system processes and stores this information in the database.
# Add Employee View:

- Endpoint: /add_emp
- Purpose: Handles both GET and POST requests.
- GET: Renders a form to add a new employee.
- POST: Processes the form data, creates a new employee record, and saves it to the database.

- Updating Employees
Users can modify existing employee information, such as updating roles, salary, or bonus.
The system ensures that changes are reflected in the database.

- Deleting Employees
Users have the option to remove employees from the system, effectively deleting their records from the database.
# Remove Employee View:

- Endpoint: /remove_emp (for displaying all employees), /remove_emp/<int:emp_id> (for removing a specific employee)
- Purpose:
  Displays all employees for the first endpoint.
  Handles the removal of a specific employee for the second endpoint.


Viewing Employee Information
The system allows users to retrieve and view the details of specific employees, aiding in quick reference and decision-making.
# All Employees View:

- Endpoint: /all_emp
- Purpose: Retrieves all employee records from the database and renders a page displaying them.

- Database Management
Employing Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), the project manages database interactions seamlessly.
Database operations are performed securely to maintain data integrity.
This project serves as a practical and effective solution for handling employee information, contributing to streamlined organizational processes and enhanced management capabilities.
